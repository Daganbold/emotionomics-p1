## Emotionomics

Did you your Cryptocurrency just lose all of its value over the span of 2 min and you dont know how to feel?
Welcome to Emotionomics!
Our goal is to allow the user to track the %change of a selected coin, and accordingly deliver a GIF to help guide how you should be feeling.
By tracking the live movement of the value of your selected coin, we calculate either your loss or your gain and randomly select the appropriate GIF.

## How to use 

Simply access our website through this link: ___ 
Once on the website, just open the drop down menu to find the list of coins and select the coin you would like to track. 
Once a coin is selected, the user should see the %change of the coin and whether they should be happy or sad!
